      <h4>Assembly Practical</h4>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>The main challenge of sequencing a genome is determining how to arrange reads into chromosomes.
        We have already explored mapping, where the sequence data is aligned to a known reference genome.
        A complementary technique, where no reference is used or available, is called <b>de novo assembly</b>.</p>
      <p><i>De novo</i> assembly is the process of reconstruction of the sample genome sequence without
        comparison to other genomes. It follows a bottom-up strategy by which reads are overlapped and
        grouped into contigs. Contigs are joined into scaffolds covering, ideally, the whole of each
        chromosome in the organism. However <i>de novo</i> assembly from next generation sequence (NGS) data
        faces several challenges. Read lengths are short and therefore detectable overlap between reads
        is lower and repeat regions harder to resolve. Longer read lengths will overcome these limitations
        but this is technology limited. These issues can also be overcome by increasing the coverage depth,
        <i>i.e.</i> the number of reads over each part of the genome. The higher the coverage then the
        greater the chance of observing overlaps among reads to create larger contigs and being able to
        span short repeat regions. In addition, the modern hardware commonly output paired-end reads.
        These are two reads that are separated by a gap of known size. They enable the resolution of
        repeats greater than the read length by employing their expected separation and orientation as
        location constraints. Sequencing errors add difficulty since algorithms must allow certain
        mismatches when overlapping reads and joining regions, possibly leading to discarding true
        overlaps and false positives (Miller, Koren, & Sutton, 2010)</p>
      <p>Despite all mentioned limitations, the high coverage currently achieved, growing read lengths
        (e.g. 100 read depth, >150bp – Illumina HiSeq2500) and paired-end information make it feasible
        to obtain assemblies from small genomes (e.g. bacterial) with relatively low fragmentation.
        Current assemblers employ graph theory to represent sequences and their overlaps as a set of
        nodes and edges, being classified into three main groups: greedy, Overlap/Layout/Consensus (OLC)
        and de Bruijn graph assemblers</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 text-center">

          <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>Graph theory is a branch of discrete mathematics that studies problems
                  of graphs. Graphs are sets of points called ‘vertices’ or ‘nodes’ joined by lines called
                  ‘edges’. In the graph to the left there are 6 nodes and 7 edges. The edges are
                  unidirectional which means that they can only be traversed in the direction of the arrow.
                  For example paths in this graph include 3-2-5-1, 3-4-6 and 3-2-1.
              </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The greedy algorithms consist of progressively adding single reads into contigs by
          end-to-end overlapping, starting with those reads with the highest overlap score and
          ending once no more joins can be found. Such scores are normally measured as the overlap
          length or the percentage of identity between reads along their joining region. SSAKE
          (Warren, Sutton, Jones, & Holt, 2007), the first short-read assembler, is based on this
          approach as well as its two descendants SHARCGS (Dohm, Lottaz, Borodina, & Himmelbauer,
          2007) and VCAKE (Jeck et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>OLC assemblers build an overlap graph, in which nodes represent the reads and edges the
          overlaps. It requires a very time-consuming first step, where all reads are compared
          against each other. Paths along the graph show likely contigs.</p>
        <p>These two algorithms (greedy and OLC) are more suited to fewer, longer reads than
          those generated with NGS technologies. De Bruijn graph assemblers are the state-of-the-art
          approach for data sets composed of many thousands of short reads.</p>
      <div class="text-center">

              <img src="img/assembly_3.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption">An example de Bruijn graph – the graph on the left is how
              modern <i>de novo</i> assemblers work (Compeau, 2007).</figcaption>
          </figure>

      </div>



          <p>De Bruijn graph assemblers start by splitting the set of reads into k-mers, a set of
            overlapping sub-reads, and then use the latter to build the graph. Each edge
            represents an observed k-mer and its adjacent nodes the prefix and suffix of the
            original k-mer. Therefore, groups of overlapping reads are not actually computed
            but rather represented as paths in the graph. In the figure above the sequence
            ATGGCGTGCA with 3-mers and overlap of 2 base pairs (bp).</p>
          <p>Since edges correspond to all k-mers existing in the sampled genome, the assembly
            is resolved by finding a path that visits every edge in the graph. This approach
            is especially suitable to handle the large number of reads because each k-mer is
            stored at most once regardless of how many times it occurs in the reads. Several
            programs implement de Bruijn graph algorithms, including Euler (Pevzner, Tang, &
            Waterman, 2001), Velvet (Zerbino & Birney, 2008), ABySS (Simpson et al., 2009),
            AllPaths (Butler et al., 2008) and SOAPdenovo (Li et al., 2010).</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the de Bruijn graph assemblers are more appropriate for large
            amounts of data from high-coverage sequencing and have become the programs of
            choice when processing short reads produced by Illumina and other established
            platforms (>100bp).</p>
          <h4>Exercise 1: De Novo Assembly using Spades</h4>
          <p><i>De novo</i> assembly is one the most computationally demanding processes in bioinformatics.
            Large genomes require many hours or days of processing. A small bacterial genome may
            take up to several hours to assemble. Here we will assemble <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genomes
            using Spades (Bankevich et al, 2012). We will compute assembly statistics to check
            the quality, and review how resulting contigs can be aligned, ordered and orientated
            along the reference genome using Abacas (Assefa, Keane, Otto, Newbold, & Berriman, 2009).</p>
          <p><b>Quick start and data checks</b></p>
          <p>Change to the data directory:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/tb</pre></code>
          <p>And list the files there:</p>
          <pre><code>ls</pre></code>
          <p>There are 6 fastq files in this directory; these are the input data for this practical.
            There are paired-end reads for three samples. To view the first 8 lines of a fastq
            file type:</p>
          <pre><code>zcat sample1_1.fastq.gz | head -8</pre></code>
          <p>This gives:</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>@HS3_5961:1:2207:17088:52965#1/1

HHHHFFHBHHHHHHHEGDDDGGEGFHHHHHHGHHHDFFEFFFDD>DB@CDAEFF?FBFGDDCCC.=?5=<@@;DA</samp></div>
        <p>Each read consists of 4 lines, the first is the read name, the second are the bases read,
          the third line is ignored and the fourth is the encoded quality of each read (one character
          per base).</p>
        <p>The number of lines in each file is reported by:</p>
        <pre><code>wc -l *</pre></code>
        <p>and therefore the number of reads can be calculated by dividing by 4.
          The length of the first read can be calculated by running:</p>
        <pre><code>zcat sample1_1.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc -c</pre></code>
        <p>This gives the number of characters in the line including the new line character,
          so it gives a number one greater than the first read length.</p>
        <p><b>Running Spades</b></p>
        <p>Spades is implemented in a single program that performs several steps in the assembly pipeline
          with a single command. The options are explained by
          running the command with no parameters (<i>spades.py</i>):</p>
        <p>You will see that there are many options and the pipeline can be customised extensively. 
          However, for most purposes we can run the tool with the default settings. You only need to 
          supply the reads and an output directory.
        </p>
        <p>An example invocation that takes the fastq formatted paired end files
          (Mtb_sample1_1.fastq.gz and Mtb_sample1_2.fastq.gz) and performs assembly.</p>
        <pre><code>spades.py -1 ~/data/tb/sample1_1.fastq.gz -2  ~/data/tb/sample1_2.fastq.gz -o sample1_asm</pre></code>
        <p>Employing <i>paired-end</i> reads (rather than single-end) increases the assembly quality.
          In general, libraries with smaller insert size produce more fragmented and shorter assemblies,
          whilst the genome coverage does not increase that much. The combination of libraries with
          different insert size always gives the best results.</p>
        <p><i>De novo</i> assembly gives much better results if reads are aggressively pre-filtered
          before passing them to the assembler. This is the same as we have seen for mapping and
          variant detection earlier in the course.</p>
        <p>Although anecdotal recommendations for the k-mer length range from lower than half of the
          read length up to 80% of read length, the parameter is difficult to determine in advance
          since it depends on coverage, read length, error rates and the sample properties (repeat
          regions, etc). Therefore, it is advisable to perform several assemblies using different
          values of k-mer length to decide a value.</p>
          <p>Thankfully spades automatically chooses a range of kmer lengths to test and chooses the best one.
            The pipeline also performs reads correction, which aims to correct random errors in reads which will
            have a knock on effect on the kmers used in the assembly. 
          </p>
        <p>Eventually, after spades finishes running there will be several files will be obtained in the directory the most 
          important for our purposes are:</p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">A fasta file (<i>contigs.fasta</i>) containing all assembled contigs</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">A fasta file (<i>scaffolds.fasta</i>) containing all assembled scaffolds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scaffolds are contigs that have been chained together into larger sequences using information 
          such from <a href="https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/mate-pair-sequencing.html">mate pair libraries</a> 
          and reference sequences. The scaffolds should be very similar to the contigs 
          in this assembly because we these reads and the insert sizes of our library are relatively small. For the rest of
          this practical we will only be analysing the contigs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Assembly quality</b></p>
        <p>The outcome of <i>de novo</i> assembly is a set of contigs. In a perfect assembly each
          contig covers exactly one chromosome in its entirety. In practice many contigs are
          created and the assembly quality is measured by examining their length; individually
          and in combination. An assembly is considered to be of good quality if relatively
          few long contigs are obtained covering the majority of the original or expected genome.
          There are different metrics used to assess the quality of assemblies:</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>N50</i>. The length of the contig that contains the middle
              nucleotide when the contigs are ordered by size. Note, N80 or N60 may also be used.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>Genome coverage</i>. If a genome reference exists then the
              genome coverage can be computed as the percentage of bases in the reference covered
              by the assembled contigs.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><i>Maximum/median/average contig size</i>. Usually computed after
              removing the smallest contigs (e.g. discarding all contigs shorter than 150 bp).</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            We can compute these statistics with the help of a tool called quast (made by the same
            developers as spades). To get the statistics first navigate to the assembly directory and 
            run quast
          </p>
          <pre><code>cd sample1_asm
quast -r ../tb.fasta -o quast contigs.fasta </pre></code>
          <p>
            After it has finished you can examing the outputs. To view the report enter <kbd>cat quast/report.txt</kbd>. 
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <div class="alert alert-warning">See if you can spot the statistics we mentioned above. 
              Compare the size of the reference with the size of the assembly. Are the 
              different?
            </div>  
          </p> 
  

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6 text-center"><div class="text-center"><img src="img/assembly_4.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><p><i>High depth of coverage</i> is essential to obtain high quality assembled
              genomes. It is always the case that contig sizes drop when coverage decreases under a certain
              value, generally considered to be 50x, although such threshold will depend on the size and
              repeat content of the sequenced genome. A coverage limit is reached above which no improvement
              on assembly metrics is observed. As shown to the left, coverage greater that 50x does
              not significantly improve N50 in an assembly of <i>E. coli</i>. Although such thresholds will
              not necessary be the same for other genomes, the principles apply for all.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>More data requires more memory too, as the lower graph demonstrates. Again the figures are genome
            specific but it is easy to see how large computers can quickly become necessary as coverage and
            genome size increase. (Illumina, 2009)</p>

        <h4>Exercise 2: Contig Ordering</h4>
          <p><b>Ordering with ABACAS</b></p>
          <p>To align, order and orientate contigs along the reference genome we will be using ABACAS (Assefa et
            al., 2009). The output will be in the form of a pseudo molecule, where all of the contigs will be
            joined by N’s. To display the complete list of possible parameters by typing:</p>
          <pre><code>abacas.pl –h</pre></code>
          <p>The basic usage (for this exercise) is:</p>
          <pre><code>cd sample1_asm
cp ~/data/tb/tb.fasta .
abacas.pl -r tb.fasta -q contigs.fasta -p nucmer -b -d -a -m -N -g sample1 -o sample1_asm</pre></code>
          <p>This will create a pseudomolecule (into <i>sample1_asm.fasta</i>) from the assembled contigs
            (in <i>contigs.fa</i>). The program creates a number of files with the same base filename for
            the other requested processing output, including gap information (<i>-g</i>, <i>sample1_asm.gaps</i>,
            <i>sample1_asm.gaps.tab</i>), a comparison file (<i>sample1_asm.crunch</i>), no padding version (<i>-n</i>,
            <i>sample1_asm.NoNs.fasta</i>), etc.</p>
          <p><b>Visualisation with ACT</b></p>
          <p>Artemis Comparison Tools (ACT) (Carver et al., 2005) is a tool for displaying pair-wise
            comparison between two or more DNA sequences. It was developed to help identify and analyse
            regions of similarity and difference between genomes along their entire sequences and their
            annotation. ABACAS produces the required files to compare the original reference genome with
             the pseudo molecule resulting after ordering assembled contigs.</p>
          <p>Launch ACT by running:</p>
          <pre><code>act</pre></code>
          <p>Click <i>File</i> > <i>Open</i>. Select the reference fasta file (<i>tb.fasta</i>) and the pseudomoelcule
            (<i>sample1_asm.fasta</i>) as the two sequence files with the associated comparison
            file (<i>sample1_asm.crunch</i>) – you will have to navigate the directories. Then press Apply. A map between
            the two sequences will be displayed. To load annotation click on <i>File > tb.fasta > Read An
            Entry...</i> and select the <i>tb.gff</i> file. To make stop codons disappear (represented as black
            vertical lines) right-click on the reference and the pseudo molecule panels and deselect <i>Stop
            Codons</i> option in the right-click menu.</p>
          <p>Right-click on a contig and select <i>View Selected Matches</i> to find out the first and last position
            the contig maps to the reference and to the pseudo molecule. The percentage of identity between them
            is also shown.</p>

              happening in nearby regions. Use the annotations and the Internet to find out the properties

              interface of ACT?</div>
            <h4>Exercise 3: Mapping back to the Reference</h4>
              <p>Contigs aligning with large internal gaps or low confidence indicate either structural variants or
                misassemblies, and should be carefully monitored. If paired-end reads are available then mapping
                them back onto the contigs (pseudo molecule) is another source of information. Large deviations in
                the mapping distance or read pairs in which only one read maps against the contigs may hint at
                misassemblies rather than structural variation</p>
              <p>The following commands maps the raw reads against the pseudo molecules from the previous exercise.
                This is a similar process to those you have used in the previous classes.</p>

              <p>This process indexes, maps and stores the fastq paired-end reads against the ABACAS
                ordered pseudomolecule (<i>sample1/sample1_asm.fasta</i>) for sample1 created by velvet with k-mer
                of 45. The output is a BAM file (<i>sample1/sample1_asm.bam</i>).</p>
              <p>This script can be modified to create a BAM file for the sequence data mapped against
                any reference genome, just as you have done in the previous class.</p>
              <p>These files can be visualised in ACT. <i>Select File > sample1_asm.fasta > Read BAM/VCF...</i> and
                choose the remapped.bam file (<i>sample1_asm.bam</i>). Do the same for tb.fasta and choose the originally
                mapped BAM file (<i>sample1.bam</i>). These BAM data are represented as pileup data – each read
                stacked up over the section of the reference that it has been mapped to. Extra information can
                be presented by right-clicking on the pileups and selecting <i>Graph > Coverage or View >

                <h4>Exercise 4: Structural Variant Validation</h4>
                <p>Structural variant (SV) software aims to detect signatures left by changes in chromosome
                  material and chromosome rearrangements. However, reads mapping to repetitive or highly
                  polymorphic regions may mimic the same signatures (false positives).</p>
                <p>Here we describe a <i>de novo</i> assembly approach that we call <i>targeted assembly of
                  candidate SV regions</i>. It consists of obtaining the reads from the predicted SV region,
                  performing <i>de novo</i> assembly and mapping the resulting contig back to the reference. The
                  nature of the contig alignment can reveal the SV.</p>
                <p>We have previously identified a deletion in sample2 in the region 79570-83050 using <i>delly</i>.
                  This region has been investigated above, in the context of a large assembly, and interesting
                  mapping and assembly results have been found.</p>
                <p>The reads are extracted from the BAM file using <i>samtools</i>. Extracting a wider range (by at
                  least 400bp) than the candidate region enables velvet to construct good contigs either side
                  of the possible SV.</p>
                <pre><code>cd ~/data/tb
samtools view -b sample1.bam Chromosome:79000-84000  | samtools fastq - > region.fastq</pre></code>
                <p>
                  The next step is to perform de novo assembly of the extracted reads.
                  We will be using another assembler called <i>spades</i>. 
                </p>
                <pre><code>spades.py -s region.fastq -o region_assembly</pre></code>
                <p>We map the output contigs back to the reference by a technique known as <i>blasting</i> it.
                  This is available as an online tool that uses a cluster to perform blasts for
                  researchers around the world. It is also available to download as a command line tool,
                  in the same way as <i>velvet</i>, <i>samtools</i> and <i>bwa</i>. The web address
                  is <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome" target="_blank">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</a>
                  and navigate to the <i>Nucleotide</i> BLAST page. Check the <i>“Align two or more sequences”</i> box.
                  Upload the contigs file (<i>~/data/tb/target51/contigs.fa</i>) as the subject and the tb reference
                  (<i>~/data/tb/tb.fasta</i>) as the query. Enter an appropriate region of the reference to
                  blast against as there is little point in searching the entire genome when we are
                  only interested in a small range (<i>79100-83900</i>).</p>

                <h4>Advanced Topics</h4>
                <p><b>Annotation Transfer</b></p>
                <p>Once the contigs ordered are against the reference, it is useful to determine the position
                  and function of possible genes. It is possible to implement ab initio gene finding, but an
                  alternative approach is to use the annotation of the reference and adapt it to the new assembly.
                  A tool called RATT (Otto et al., 2011 “Rapid annotation transfer tools”) has been developed
                  to transfer the annotation from a reference to a new assembly. In the first step the similarity
                  between the two sequences is determined and a synteny map is constructed. This map is used to
                  align the annotation of the reference onto the new sequence. In a second step, the algorithm
                  tries to correct gene models. One advantages of RATT is that the complete annotation is
                  transferred, including descriptions. Thus careful manual annotation from the reference becomes
                  available in the newly sequenced genome. Where no synteny exists, no transfer can be performed.
                  An outputted combined “embl” format file with sequence and inferred annotation can be viewed in
                   <i>artemis</i> to assess the quality of the transfer.</p>
                <p><b>Improving assemblies</b></p>
                <p>The quality of the assembly is determined by a number of factors, including the type of software
                  used, the length of reads and the repetitive nature or complexity of the genome. For example,
                  assembly of <i>Plasmodium</i> is more difficult than that of most bacteria (due to the high AT content
                  and repeats). A good assembly of a bacterial genome will return 20-100 supercontigs. It is
                  possible to manually / visually improve assemblies and annotation within <i>Artemis</i>. To improve
                  the assembly in a more automated fashion, there is other software:</p>
                <p><b>SSPACE</b>: This tool can scaffold contigs. Although velvet can also scaffold contigs, SSPACE
                  generally performs better.</p>
                <p><b>Abacas</b>:  has the option to design primers that can be used to generate a PCR product to
                  span a possible gap. The resulting new sequence can then be included in the assembly. This
                  process is called finishing.</p>
                <p><b>Image</b>: is a tool that can close gaps in the assembly automatically. First the reads are
                  mapped against the assembly. Using all reads that map close to a gap and with their mate pairs
                  within the gap, it is possible to perform a local assembly. This process is repeated iteratively.
                  This procedure can close up to 80% of the sequencing gaps (Tasi et al, 2010).</p>
                <p><b>iCORN</b> (Otto et al, 2010) can correct base errors in the sequence. Reads are mapped
                  against the reference and differences are called. Those differences or variants that surpass
                  a specified quality threshold are corrected. A correction is accepted if the amount of perfect
                  mapping reads does not decrease. This algorithm also runs iteratively. Here, perfect mapping
                  refers to the read and its mate pair mapping in the expected insert size without any difference
                  to the iteratively derived reference.</p>
                <p>All these programs are available through the PAGIT suite (post assembly genome improvement
                  toolkit, <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/pagit/" target="_blank">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/pagit/</a>).
